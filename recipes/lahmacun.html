        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Step 1:</strong>Heat a large skillet over medium heat. 
                Add lamb, pureed vegetable mixture, and tomato paste; mix well. 
                Cook and stir until lamb is cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes. 
                Stir in cayenne pepper and salt to taste. 
                Transfer mixture to a shallow baking dish to cool to room temperature. 
                Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Step 2:</strong>Heat a large skillet over medium heat. 
                Add lamb, pureed vegetable mixture, and tomato paste; mix well. 
                Cook and stir until lamb is cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes. 
                Stir in cayenne pepper and salt to taste. 
                Transfer mixture to a shallow baking dish to cool to room temperature. 
                Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Step 3:</strong>Make dough: 
                Dissolve yeast and sugar in 1 cup warm water. 
                Combine flour and salt in a large bowl and stir well. 
                Add 1/2 cup water and oil to yeast mixture and pour over flour mixture. 
                Use your hands to mix dough. 
                Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and 
                knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Step 4:</strong>Shape dough into a ball and transfer to an oiled bowl. 
                Cover with a wet towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk, 
                about 1 hour. Remove lamb sauce from the refrigerator
                 and allow to come up to room temperature.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Step 5:</strong>Meanwhile, make garlic sauce: 
                Combine yogurt, parsley, and garlic in a small bowl. 
                Season with salt and pepper. Stir well and set aside.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Step 6:</strong>Punch dough down, 
                transfer it to a floured work surface, 
                and cut into 10 portions. 
                Shape each portion into a round. 
                Flatten each round with your hand; 
                use a rolling pin to roll each piece into a 10-inch circle. 
                The dough should be thin, like a crepe. 
                Place the rounds on parchment paper.
            </li>            
            <li><strong>Step 7:</strong>Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). 
                Line baking sheets with parchment paper.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Step 8:</strong>Stir lamb sauce and spoon it onto a dough round. 
                Spread it thinly to the edges and press down lightly so it sticks. 
                Place on the prepared baking sheets.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Step 9:</strong>Bake pizzas on the lowest oven rack in
                the preheated oven until the edges are a light tan color, 
                8 to 10 minutes. Place on a wire rack to cool. 
                The pizzas can be stored in an airtight container 
                in the refrigerator for 3 days or in the freezer for 3 months. 
                To reheat, place pizzas in a 350 degrees F oven (175 degrees C) for 8 minutes.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Step 10:</strong>Assemble lahmacun: 
                Drizzle pizzas with garlic sauce, 
                top with shredded cabbage, and roll up to eat.
