        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
            <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
            <li>2 ½ cups bread flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Step 1:</strong>Gather all ingredients.
                Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C), and lightly grease a pizza pan.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Step 2:</strong>Place warm water in a bowl;
                add yeast and sugar. Mix and let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Step 3:</strong>Add flour, oil, and salt
                to the yeast mixture; beat until smooth. 
                You can do this by hand or use a stand mixer 
                fitted with a dough hook to make it easier.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Step 4:</strong>Let rest for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 5:</strong>Turn dough out onto a lightly 
                floured surface and pat or roll into a 12-inch circle.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Step 6:</strong>Transfer to the prepared pizza pan.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 7:</strong>Spread crust with sauce and toppings of your choice.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 8:</strong>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown,
                15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for 5 minutes before serving.
